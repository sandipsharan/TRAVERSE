# TRAVERSE - Traffic-Responsive Autonomous Vehicle Experience & Rare-event Simulation for Enhanced Safety

Welcome to the TRAVERSE repository!

TRAVERSE is a project aimed at developing a simulator to collect data of traffic-responsive autonomous vehicles to enhance safety, particularly focusing on rare events. This repository houses the code and resources for the simulation system.

## Introduction 

This study employs a virtual reality (VR) vehicle simulator to investigate various accidental scenarios encountered in traffic, aiming to elucidate human responses and behaviors in simulated accidents. By utilizing a robust traffic simulation framework developed within the Unity Game Engine, our research delves into the dynamics of driving safety. Notably, our simulation framework integrates low-cost immersive driving simulator hardware, facilitating accessibility for user studies in the realm of autonomous driving research.

## Installation

The code for the simulator will be open-sourced shortly after the paper is published.

## Features

- Interactive Traffic Simulation
- Customizable Scenario Creation
- Server Connectivity
- Weather Conditions, Day/Night Simulation
- Functional Vehicle Features
- ROS Compatibility
- Eye Gaze, Head Pose, & Hand Tracking
 - Gameplay Recording
